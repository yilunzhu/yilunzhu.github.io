- My name is Yilun Zhu (朱逸伦).

- I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at Georgetown University, advised by Dr. [Amir Zeldes](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/amir/).

- My research interests lie in how semantic and discourse features are represented in computational linguistics/natural language processing. Specifically, I work on coreference resolution, paraphrasing, and adpositional supersenses.

- I am a member of [CorpLing@GU](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/corpling/) and an affiliated member of [NERT](http://nert.georgetown.edu/).

- I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/).

- My name is Yilun Zhu (朱逸伦).

- I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at Georgetown University, working with Dr. <a href="https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/amir/">Amir Zeldes</a> and Dr. <a href="http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/">Nathan Schneider</a>.

- My research interests lie in how semantic and discourse features are represented in computational linguistics/natural language processing. Specifically, I work on coreference resolution, which is a idscoure-level task identifying all coreferent relations in a given document.

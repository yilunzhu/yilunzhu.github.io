- My name is Yilun Zhu (朱逸伦).

- I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at Georgetown University, working with Dr. [Amir Zeldes](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/amir/) and Dr. [Nathan Schneider](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/).

- My research interests lie in how semantic and discourse features are represented in computational linguistics/natural language processing. Specifically, I work on coreference resolution, paraphrasing, and adpositional supersenses.

- I am a member of [CorpLing@GU](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/corpling/), [NERT](http://nert.georgetown.edu/) and [GUCL](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/GUCL/).

- I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/).
